    <!-- For Parents: Track Your Child’s Bus or Van Journey with Ease and Peace of Mind
Our Bus & Van Tracking System offers parents the ability to monitor their child’s journey from the moment they board the bus or van until they safely arrive at their destination. Here’s how parents can use the system to ensure their child’s safety and stay informed in real time:

1. Real-Time Bus & Van Tracking
Track Your Child's Bus in Real-Time: Using the app or website, parents can easily track the live location of the bus or van that their child is on. Know exactly where the bus is at any point in time.
Estimated Arrival Times: Receive accurate updates on when the bus or van will arrive at your child’s pickup or drop-off point, helping you avoid waiting and ensuring you're ready when the bus arrives.
    
2. Instant Notifications and Alerts
Live Arrival Alerts: Get automatic notifications when the bus is approaching your child’s stop, so you can be prepared for their arrival.
Delay Alerts: If the bus or van is delayed, parents will receive real-time updates, so they can plan accordingly and avoid unnecessary waiting.
Emergency Notifications: In case of any unexpected issues (such as an accident or route change), the system will instantly notify parents to keep them informed.
    
3. Safe Pickup and Drop-off Monitoring
Know When Your Child Boards or Disembarks: The system tracks when your child boards or leaves the bus, providing a record of their trip. This ensures that you know your child has safely arrived at school or home.
Pick-up/Drop-off Confirmation: Receive notifications when your child has been picked up or dropped off at their designated stop, providing an added layer of security and peace of mind.

Instant Messaging: If needed, you can quickly communicate with the school administration or the bus driver through the platform in case of an emergency, questions, or concerns.
Emergency Contact Information: In case you need to reach out urgently, the system provides direct contact details for both the school and bus driver.
