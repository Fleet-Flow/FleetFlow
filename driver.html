    <!-- For Drivers: Efficient, Safe, and Hassle-Free Bus & Van Management
Our Bus & Van Tracking System helps drivers streamline their routes, manage schedules, and ensure the safety of passengers. Here's how drivers can use the system to enhance their daily operations:

1. Access Live Route Details
Real-Time Route Navigation: Drivers can easily view the current route and upcoming stops via the app or website, ensuring they stay on the correct path without missing any students.
Optimized Routing: The system provides efficient route suggestions, helping avoid traffic jams, road closures, or delays, making your journey smoother and more predictable.
    
2. Instant Notifications for Stops and Timings
Stop Reminders: The system sends automatic reminders for each pickup and drop-off point. No need to manually track the schedule—just follow the prompts.
Delay Alerts: If you’re running behind schedule, the system notifies both you and the school admin, allowing them to inform parents and students in real-time.
    
3. Safety Monitoring & Reporting
Speed & Route Monitoring: The system tracks your speed and ensures you're following the designated route. This helps maintain safety standards and keep students secure during transit.
Incident Reporting: In case of emergencies or road incidents, drivers can instantly report the issue through the system, which notifies the school or institute admin for quick action.
    
4. Effortless Communication
Direct Contact: If needed, drivers can quickly contact the school administration or parents directly through the platform, making communication fast and easy.
Student Pickup Confirmation: Notify school staff or parents when a student is picked up or dropped off, keeping everyone in the loop.
    
5. Bus & Van Maintenance Tracking
Maintenance Alerts: The system can send reminders for bus or van maintenance, helping you keep the vehicle in top condition. This reduces the chances of breakdowns and ensures smooth operations.
Vehicle Health Monitoring: Log regular checks and record any issues with the bus or van to maintain accurate service records.
    
6. Efficient Reporting & Performance Insights
Daily Reports: Track your performance with real-time data on bus timing, stops, and efficiency. This helps you monitor your day-to-day operations and improve your driving performance.
Route History: Review past routes, delays, and feedback to make improvements for future trips.
